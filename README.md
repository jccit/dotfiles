# dotfiles

My personal config for macOS and Linux

## What this installs

* Homebrew
* Xcode Command Line Tools
* Git
* Zsh
* Starship
* NVM
* VSCode
* Firefox
* Probably more when I can be bothered to add it

## Additional things

* Applies a few macOS tweaks (hidden files, file extensions, text selection in quick look)
* Installs ICC profiles for my monitors
* Modular zshrc with private config and platform specifics

Run `install.sh` after a fresh install
